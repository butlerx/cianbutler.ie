## Experience

### SRE for CoderDojo &emsp; <small>_July 2017 - December 2017_</small>

`Node.js`, `Python`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `AWS`, `Linux`, `PostgreSQL`, `Graphite`

> I worked on migrating CoderDojo's [Zen platform](https://zen.coderdojo.com) from single AWS
> instances that were difficult to scale to a Kubernetes cluster, allowing an independent scaling
> for each microservice as well as the ability to scale the cluster as needed. This also simplifies
> Zen's setup and deployment. After migrating to Kubernetes I began upgrading the deployment
> pipeline as well as the Node version and dependencies for all the microservices. I was also
> responsible for monitoring all the infrastructure using new-relic and graphite.

`Python`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`

> I was a DCU lab tutor for the year. I helped students with lab problems and make sure they
> understood how their program worked. I had to be able to explain different issues and help
> students understand how best to write in their respective language.
