      DCU has given me experience with crypto & secure programming. I became
      familiar with programming in many languages and for different platforms. A
      large number of topics were covered including search technologies,
      distributed and thread programming, compilers, cryptography, database
      design and network design and implementation. I gained experience using
      UML, Scrum and agile as well as becoming familiar with source control
      through group projects.
