      Zen is CoderDojo''s community platform. It allows people to get involved,
      with the CoderDojo movement, find Dojos, chat to other members and keep
      themselves informed about their local Dojo.  For my Final Year Project, I
      Implemented Zen''s new development environment and implemented a scalable
      and modular setup for each mircoservice.

    repo: 'https://github.com/butlerx/wetty'
    description: >
      Terminal over HTTP and HTTPS. Wetty is an alternative to ajaxterm/anyterm
      but much better than them because wetty uses ChromeOS'' terminal emulator
      (hterm) which is a full fledged implementation of terminal emulation
      written entirely in Javascript. Also it uses websockets instead of Ajax
      and hence better response time.
