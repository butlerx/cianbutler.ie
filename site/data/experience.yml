      I worked on migrating CoderDojo's
      [Zen platform](https://zen.coderdojo.com) from single AWS instances that
      were difficult to scale to a Kubernetes cluster, allowing an independent
      scaling for each microservice as well as the ability to scale the cluster
      as needed. This also simplifies Zen's setup and deployment. After
      migrating to Kubernetes I began upgrading the deployment pipeline as well
      as the Node version and dependencies for all the microservices. I was also
      responsible for monitoring all the infrastructure using new-relic and
      graphite.

      I was a DCU lab tutor for the year. I helped students with lab problems
      and make sure they understood how their program worked. I had to be able
      to explain different issues and help students understand how best to write
      in their respective language.

      At Redbrick I was part of a team of three. I was in charge of maintaining
      all web-related service. This meant maintaining uptime on servers,
      managing and upgrading user web services including user web-spaces and
