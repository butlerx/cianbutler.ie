As the lead Site Reliability Engineer at a security-focused startup, I contribute to the design and implementation of
critical infrastructure and services that enable secure payment processing and data protection.

My key achievements include:

Collaborated on the development and scaling of a Confidential Computing platform using secure enclaves, working with
the team to enable customers to run sensitive workloads in fully attested environments. Successfully optimised and
scaled both Rust and Node.js-based API services to meet growing demand while maintaining performance and reliability.

Contributed to the development of a transparent HTTP encryption proxy service that helps customers achieve PCI DSS
compliance through automated data protection, and supported the implementation of a 3D Secure payment gateway
integration, expanding our payment processing capabilities.

Established comprehensive incident management frameworks and automation, fostering a culture of continuous improvement
through systematic incident analysis and learning. This includes designing monitoring solutions and operational
tooling that enhance service reliability and team efficiency.

Site Reliability Engineer at Demonware, supporting online gaming services for major AAA titles including Call of Duty.
Progressed through multiple specialised teams, focusing on monitoring, data pipelines, and observability while
handling massive scale requirements.

Contributed as a core team member to the design and implementation of an automated monitoring and alerting pipeline
that successfully replaced manual NOC operations. Engineered and maintained high-throughput data pipelines processing
billions of real-time telemetry datapoints per second from millions of concurrent users.

Led the migration and unification of disparate logging and tracing systems to an OpenTelemetry-based distributed
tracing platform, standardising observability practices across all Python services within the organisation. This
unified approach significantly improved cross-service visibility and troubleshooting capabilities.

Participated in the Root Cause Analysis review group, contributing to the improvement of post-incident review
processes by reviewing major incidents and providing technical guidance to teams. This work helped establish more
effective practices for learning from and documenting system failures.
