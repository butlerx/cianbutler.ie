    summary: >
      I worked on migrating CoderDojo's [Zen
      platform](https://zen.coderdojo.com) from single AWS instances that were
      difficult to scale to a Kubernetes cluster, allowing an independent
      scaling for each microservice as well as the ability to scale the cluster
      as needed. This also simplifies Zen's setup and deployment. After
      migrating to Kubernetes I began upgrading the deployment pipeline as well
      as the Node version and dependencies for all the microservices. I was also
      responsible for monitoring all the infrastructure using NewRelic and
      Graphite.
